  abstract: 'The Middle East is a key area for understanding the evolutionary history of humans, and one of the most complex. It is one of the possible centres of the expansion of modern humans outside Africa and an established source of subsequent expansions such as that during the Neolithic into Europe and possibly North Africa. It is also likely to have experienced many less-understood migrations in several directions relevant to the history of Africa, Asia and Europe. Yet the genomics of populations in this area have been little-studied. In the current project, we propose to investigate the genomics of a Lebanese sample. We chose Lebanon because its history in the last few thousand years is relatively well-understood. In addition, our previous studies on the Lebanese population suggest Lebanon could have been a refuge for the earliest indigenous populations in the region. In this project we plan to (1) genotype 120 Lebanese individuals analyzing 2.5M variants (2) 8x sequence 100 individuals and (3) 30x sequence 4 individuals. '

  abstract: 'AML is an unmet medical need and therapeutic progress will not be made without a greater understanding of this heterogeneous disease. The largest subgroup of AML patients lack a cytogenetic abnormality (AML with normal Karyotype, AML-NK). For this reason, the biology of this subtype have been historically poorly understood. Recently, next generation sequencing efforts in AML-NK genomes has described a number of recurrent abnormalities. In parallel, mouse models have dramatically improved our understanding of disease and due to the great similarities between mouse and human haematopoiesis, have been particularly informative for leukaemia. We aim to model 4 of the most frequent AML-NK mutations using sophisticated mouse models. We will assess the preleukaemic/leukaemic cellular characteristics of these models, particularly their effects on the homeostasis of the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment. We will also perform integrated genomic analysis to link the mutations and their altered cellular phenotype to aberrant epigenetic control and pre/leukaemic gene expression programmes.     '
