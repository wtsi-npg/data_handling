  abstract: "Multidrug resistance, strong side effects, and compliance problems in TB chemotherapy mandate new ways to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here we show that deletion of the gene encoding homoserine transacetylase (metA) inactivates methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis in Mtb and renders this pathogen exquisitely sensitive to killing in immunocompetent or immunocompromised mice, leading to rapid clearance from host tissues. Mtb ?metA is unable to proliferate in primary human macrophages, and in vitro starvation leads to extraordinarily rapid killing with no appearance of suppressor mutants. Cell death of Mtb ?metA is faster than that of other auxotrophic mutants (i.e., tryptophan, pantothenate, leucine, biotin), suggesting a particularly potent mechanism of killing. Time-course metabolomics showed complete depletion of intracellular methionine and SAM. SAM depletion was consistent with a significant decrease in methylation at the DNA level (measured by single-molecule real-time sequencing) and with the induction of several essential methyltransferases involved in biotin and menaquinone biosynthesis, both of which are vital biological processes and validated targets of antimycobacterial drugs. Mtb ?metA could be partially rescued by biotin supplementation, confirming a multitarget cell death mechanism. The work presented here uncovers a previously unidentified vulnerability of Mtb-the incapacity to scavenge intermediates of SAM and methionine biosynthesis from the host. This vulnerability unveils an entirely new drug target space with the promise of rapid killing of the tubercle bacillus by a new mechanism of action.\r\nThis data is part of a pre-publication release.

  abstract: 'The Middle East is a key area for understanding the evolutionary history of humans, and one of the most complex. It is one of the possible centres of the expansion of modern humans outside Africa and an established source of subsequent expansions such as that during the Neolithic into Europe and possibly North Africa. It is also likely to have experienced many less-understood migrations in several directions relevant to the history of Africa, Asia and Europe. Yet the genomics of populations in this area have been little-studied. In the current project, we propose to investigate the genomics of a Lebanese sample. We chose Lebanon because its history in the last few thousand years is relatively well-understood. In addition, our previous studies on the Lebanese population suggest Lebanon could have been a refuge for the earliest indigenous populations in the region. In this project we plan to (1) genotype 120 Lebanese individuals analyzing 2.5M variants (2) 8x sequence 100 individuals and (3) 30x sequence 4 individuals. '

  abstract: "Very little is known about genome diversity of herpesviruses and there are currently very few genome sequences in Genbank. Whole genome sequencing of large DNA viruses is complicated by the difficulty in separating virus DNA from human DNA. In this project we will address this issue by using Agilent SureSelect technology and Illumina deep sequencing to sequence several members of the herpesvirus family, including Epstein Barr virus (EBV, HHV4), Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV, HHV8) and varicella zoster virus (VZV, HHV3). We have designed custom baits to the available reference sequences and will use these to pull out virus sequence from host DNA and then Illumina sequence the captured virus DNA. The short read data will be assembled into a genome consensus sequence for each virus and importantly, allow analysis of virus minority species, which may be important for pathogenesis.\r\n\r\nWe will use a range of samples including DNA from cell lines latently infected with either EBV or KSHV or both viruses. These data will enable an initial estimation of genome diversity and highlight differences at the genetic level between EBV and KSHV from different cell lines. Further studies will generate herpesvirus genome sequences from clinical samples, including varicella, Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma to investigate virus genetic diversity and pathogenic determinants.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/viruses/herpesviridae-lymphocryptovirus.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/viruses/herpesviridae-rhadinovirus.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/viruses/herpesviridae-simplexvirus.html\r\n"

  description: "Genome assembly in vertebrates is still very difficult, mainly due to the typically large repeat content. Consequently, genome assemblies based purely on Illumina short reads tend to be highly fragmented and/or contain large gaps. Recently, PacBio long reads have been used successfully by a number of genome projects to span across the repetitive regions and provide highly contiguous assemblies.   Milan Malinsky has generated three Illumina assemblies of cichlid genomes, using a trio assembly approach he developed during his PhD with Richard Durbin. Here we are proposing to obtain long PacBio reads to: a) greatly improve one of the cichlid assemblies (A. calliptera) for use in ongoing population genomics research; b) build up informatics expertise in the rapidly expanding field of PacBio genome assembly.\r\nThis data is part of a pre-publication release.

  abstract: 'AML is an unmet medical need and therapeutic progress will not be made without a greater understanding of this heterogeneous disease. The largest subgroup of AML patients lack a cytogenetic abnormality (AML with normal Karyotype, AML-NK). For this reason, the biology of this subtype have been historically poorly understood. Recently, next generation sequencing efforts in AML-NK genomes has described a number of recurrent abnormalities. In parallel, mouse models have dramatically improved our understanding of disease and due to the great similarities between mouse and human haematopoiesis, have been particularly informative for leukaemia. We aim to model 4 of the most frequent AML-NK mutations using sophisticated mouse models. We will assess the preleukaemic/leukaemic cellular characteristics of these models, particularly their effects on the homeostasis of the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment. We will also perform integrated genomic analysis to link the mutations and their altered cellular phenotype to aberrant epigenetic control and pre/leukaemic gene expression programmes.     '
