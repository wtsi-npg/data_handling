=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::Data::BamDeletion

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Update specified iRODS files leaving behind a header file for alignment files and a stub mentioning consent withdrawn for other files.  File name remains the same as the original.

The original meta data is attached and the RT ticket added.

For use with e.g. iRODS files identified with npg_process_consent_withdrawn.pl
