=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::HTS::ONT::GridIONRunMonitor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Polls a staging area for new GridION experiment result
directories. Launches a WTSI::NPG::HTS::ONT::GridIONRunPublisher for
each existing device directory and for any new device directory
created. A GridIONRunMonitor does not monitor directories below a
device directory; that responsibility is delegated to its child
processes. Each child process is responsible for one device directory.

The filesystem polling interval is set to 60 seconds by default. Once
a publisher completes processing a device directory successfully, no
attempt will be made to process it again for the duration of the quiet
interval, which defaults to 24 hours.

A GridIONRunMonitor will store data in iRODS beneath one collection:

<collection>/<gridion hostname>/<experiment name><device id>/

The following scenarios are supported:


1. Pre-existing complete (inactive) and fully published runs

A publisher is started and will time out due to inactivity. On exiting
it will check that all files are published and exit without publishing
any. It will check and update secondary metadata on all files
previously published.


2. Pre-existing complete (inactive) and partially published runs

A publisher is started and will time out due to inactivity. On exiting
it will check that all files are published and exit after publishing
the remainder. It will check and update secondary metadata on all
files published and previously published.


3. Pre-existing incomplete (active) runs

A publisher is started and will first publish new files as it detects
their creation. On exiting it will check that all files are published
and exit after publishing the remainder. It will check and update
secondary metadata on all files published and previously published.


4. Future runs

A publisher is started when a new device directory is created. It will
first publish new files as it detects their creation. On exiting it
will check that all files are published and exit after publishing any
remainder. It will check and update secondary metadata on all files
published and previouslt published.


=head1 BUGS

This class uses inotify to detect when directories are created and
when data files are closed after writing. If experiment and device
directories are created after the monitor has started up and checked
for existing directories, but before inotify watches are set up, they
will not be detected and their contents will not published.

TODO -- replace the on-startup check for unknown directories with a
periodic check.
