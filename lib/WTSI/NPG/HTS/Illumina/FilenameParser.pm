=head2 parse_file_name

  Arg [1]      Full path or file name of a file named using
               the NPG convention for run/lane/plex data

  Example    : my @pg_records = $obj->get_records($header, 'PG');
  Description: Return an array containing run identifier, position,
               tag index, alignment filter subset and format (suffix).
               The tag index and/or alignment filter values may be
               undef. The file mustbe named using the NPG convention
               for run/lane/plex data e.g.

                  17550_1.cram
                  17550_1#0.cram
                  17550_1#0_F0x900.stats
                  17550_1#0_phix.cram
                  17550_1#0_phix_F0x900.stats

=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::HTS::Illumina::FilenameParser

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is to be used where it is necessary to parse the names of
Illumina sequencing data files produced by NPG. The file names are
structured such that their run identifier, lane position, plex (if
any) and alignment filters (if any) may be determined.

This should be considered a legacy or last resort method of
determining this information. Future work should use the
npg_tracking::glossary::composition package to determine the
provenance of data in sequencing results.
