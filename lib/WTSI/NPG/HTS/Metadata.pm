=head1 NAME

WTSI::NPG::HTS::Metadata

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package exports "constants" for describing metadata.

It serves the same purpose as WTSI::NPG::iRODS::Metadata in the
perl-dnap-utilities repository, and should be merged into that package.
Once a new version of WTSI::NPG::iRODS::Metadata is released with the
constants from WTSI::NPG::HTS::Metadata, this package can be removed.
